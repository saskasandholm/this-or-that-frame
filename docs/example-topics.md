## Implementation Notes

### Topic Selection Strategy

- Begin with universally appealing topics (#1, #11, #21, #31, #41)
- Save controversial topics for when engagement is established
- Alternate between categories to maintain interest
- Time market-related topics to coincide with relevant events
- Use Farcaster-specific topics when platform discussions are trending

### Presentation Guidelines

For each topic:

1. Use clear, concise language
2. Include visually distinct imagery for each option
3. Keep descriptions brief but thought-provoking
4. Ensure balanced framing that doesn't favor either option
5. Add context when needed but keep focus on the binary choice

### Engagement Patterns

Based on similar formats across platforms:

- Crypto topics typically see 30-40% higher engagement than general topics
- Controversial topics generate 2-3x more shares than neutral ones
- Topics tied to current events see 50% higher participation
- Personal identity topics receive more comments than technical ones
- Visual topics (with clear imagery) perform better than text-only options
